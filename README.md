# k8s Cluster Pre Installtion

Git clone the kubespray github project.

Creating the cluster inventory hosts: 
- cp -r inventory/sample inventory/dev-cluter
- declare -a IPS=(192.168.1.51 192.168.1.52 192.168.1.53)  < put here the nodes IP for the cluster 
- CONFIG_FILE=inventory/dev-cluter/hosts.yml python3 contrib/inventory_builder/inventory.py ${IPS[@]}
look at below image for expeted output :

Inverntory should look like this: 
'''
